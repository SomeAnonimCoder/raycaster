RAYCASTER

is a simple 3d render written in python3. It works on classical raycasting algorithm, so there ain`t no suh thing as height or levels.
DEPENDENCIES:

*python-keyboard(On Linux you need SUDO to use this!) for reading keyboards
*PIL(or PILlow - it's much faster!) for image processing
NB! you can run this in cpython(default implementation of python) but you`d better use PyPy - it makes this faster and works fine!

INSTALLATION:
#cloning
git clone https://github.com/someanonimcoder/raycaster
cd raycaster
#dependencies
